# Journey Planner



This project demonstrates how a Serenity/JS test scenario can interact with 
a non-Angular app - the [TFL's Journey Planner](https://tfl.gov.uk/) 
and acts as a supporting material for my Devoxx UK 2017 talk ["Test-driving modern web apps at scale"](https://cfp.devoxx.co.uk/2017/talk/UTM-3900/Test-driving_modern_web_apps._At_scale._)

To run the example:
```
npm install
npm test
```

Once the test execution is complete, you'll find the test report at:

```
target/site/serenity/index.html
```

To remove the test report and start fresh run:

```
npm run clean
```

Please make sure that you're using the latest [long-term support](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) of Node.js

Have fun!
